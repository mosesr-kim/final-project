## Motive

Have you ever had the problem of figuring out what to eat? I know I have whenever I went out with my friends. On a daily basis, I use the Yelp app to find restaurants near me but it was missing one thing, picking a restaurant for you. I combined my favorite app with an extra feature, a randomizer. I wanted to create a collection of restaurants that I searched for and then have one chosen for you in an instant. Less time debating is more time for coding ðŸ˜‰
